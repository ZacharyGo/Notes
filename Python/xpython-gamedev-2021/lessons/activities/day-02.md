# day 02 activity

## create a simple guessing game

this exercise will let you apply the basic syntax in python for implementing conditional statements, loop statements , and other simple processes

this exercise will also introduce the use of the random package. this will be used to generate a random number needed by the program.

### requirement 01
- the program will ask the user to input a number in between 0-100
- the program compares the input with the generated random number.
- if it is lower, the program prints "lower" and ask the user to input a new one
- if it is higher, the program prints "higher" and ask the user to input a new one
- if it is equal, the program prints "correct"

### requirement 02
- once the user guessed the correct number, the program should ask if the user wants to guess a new number.
- if yes, the process in requirement 01 is repeated.
- if no, the program prints the average number of times the user tried to guess a number then exits.
